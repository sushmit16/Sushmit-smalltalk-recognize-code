# Sushmit-smalltalk-recognize-code
Our project was to develop a chatbot for our website and we used 2 cloud platforms(GCP and AWS) and we were required to merge the both platforms, so these code will help you to recognize smalltalks from GCP.
later on you can use this code and upload it on AWS so if any requests from GCP comes you can direct it to GCP and it will reply it back accordingly.
